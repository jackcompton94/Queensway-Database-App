# queenswayDatabaseApp

## Purpose
This desktop application allows a user to interact with a simple PostgresSQL database that hosts shows and event details from my band Queensway (pulled from IG @queenswayband)

In order for a user to interact you must register an account and login (READ ONLY). Once logged in, the application uses abstraction leveraged by SQL queries over the database.

## Stack
- PostgresSQL
- .NET Framework
- C++
