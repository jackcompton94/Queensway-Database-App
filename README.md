# Queensway-Database-App

## Purpose
This desktop application allows a user to interact with a SQL Server database that hosts all 'show' and 'event' details from my band Queensway (pulled from our Instagram: @queenswayband)

In order for a user to interact you must register an account and login. Once logged in, the application uses filtering that abstracts from SQL queries over the database to present stats and information related to the band's history.

## Stack
- SQL Server
- .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
- C++
